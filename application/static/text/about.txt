I am a master's student who loves image creation and visual storytelling. I usually like to shoot and edit various types of videos, from travel records to creative short films. Currently familiar with using various editing software such as GoPro Studio, Adobe Premiere Pro, PowerDirector and CapCut, he is good at combining music and rhythm to create impressive images. Through videos, I hope to convey stories and emotions, so that every scene has its own warmth and meaning.
